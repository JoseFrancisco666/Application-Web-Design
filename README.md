# What is Markdown used for?
Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to format text using simple plain-text symbols. It is primarily used for:
1. Creating clear and readable technical documentation.
2. Writing README files in GitHub repositories.
3. Facilitating the conversion of plain text into HTML format without the need for complex tags.
